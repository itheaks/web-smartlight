        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>This project leverages the versatile Arduino Nano as the central control unit to process data 
            and manage the connected components. The project features a pair of HC-SR04 ultrasonic 
            sensors, a NE555 timer, a relay, a diode, two resistors (200k ohm and 10k ohm), two capacitors 
            (22 micro F and 0.01 micro F), and a Common Cathode 7-Segment Display. The primary goal 
            of this project is to measure distances in two distinct directions, visualize the results using a 7-
            segment display, and control an external load based on specific conditions. This 
            comprehensive report offers an in-depth understanding of the project, its materials, working 
            principles, and a conclusive summary. </p>

        <h2>Code Explanation:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/itheaks/iot-smartlight">GitHub Repository Link</a></p>
        <h3>Arduino Code Components:</h3>
        <p>The Arduino code provided orchestrates the operation of the project and can be broken down into several critical components:</p>
    
        <h3>Library Inclusion and Variable Definitions:</h3>
        <p><pre><code>
            #include "SevSeg.h"
        </code></pre><br>
        The code begins by including the "SevSeg" library, which is crucial for controlling the 7-segment display. It also defines pins for sensors, the relay, and other variables used in the project.</p>
    
        <h3>Setup Function:</h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
            void setup() {
            // Initialization and pin configurations
            }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Inside the <code>setup()</code> function, the Arduino initializes serial communication, sets up the 7-segment display, and configures the modes for various pins used in the project.</p>
    
        <h3>Loop Function:</h3>
        <pre><code>
            void loop() {
            // Main control logic and sensor measurements
            }
        </code></pre>
        <p>The <code>loop()</code> function houses the central logic of the project. It comprises the following components:</p>
    
        <h3>Ultrasonic Sensor Measurements:</h3>
        <p>The code triggers and measures the response time of the ultrasonic sensors (distance1 and distance2) to calculate distances in two directions.</p>
    
        <h3>Read Timer and Other Sensor Inputs:</h3>
        <p>The code reads the state of the timer (timer_output) and stores it in 'read1'. Additionally, other sensors' states are read and stored in 'read', potentially influencing the project's control logic.</p>
    
        <h3>7-Segment Display Update:</h3>
        <p>The 7-segment display is updated to show the current value of the variable 'i'.</p>
    
        <h3>Relay Control:</h3>
        <p>The relay's state is controlled based on the value of 'i' and the distance measured by the rear ultrasonic sensor ('distance2'). When 'i' is greater than 0, the relay is set to HIGH, indicating activation of an external load.</p>
    
        <h3>Control Logic:</h3>
        <p>The code's control logic rigorously assesses various conditions to determine the value of 'i'. For example, 'i' increases when the timer and certain distance conditions are met, while 'i' decreases under distinct criteria.</p>

                    <li>The relay, likely used to control an external load, is influenced by the value of 'i' and the distance measured by the second ultrasonic sensor ('distance2').</li>
                    <li>If 'i' is greater than 0, the relay is set to HIGH, indicating the activation of an external load.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Control Logic:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The code's control logic is meticulous, examining a range of conditions to establish the value of 'i'. For instance, 'i' increases under specific timer and distance conditions, and it decreases under distinct circumstances.</li>
                    <li>The relay is also controlled based on the value of 'i' and the distance measurement from the rear ultrasonic sensor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
